Note: 
Apps that have "Install as Duplicate" means that that IPA will be installed along side the App Store version
Apps that have "Non Duplicate" means that they are installed instead of the App Store one. 

Also know that sideloaded apps will NOT get notifications. That is why I included the IPA just compiled as Duplicate so that you can receive notifications through the App Store one if you choose to want Notifications.

Regarding YouTube++ with No Ads. This just removes the ads from the videos themselves. If you want to remove the ads on the bottom you have to buy the license, $2 I believe, and make an account. That account can be used across all of his ++ tweaks to remove ads. A 1 time fee of $2 to remove all ads across all of his ++ apps. All you need is the account you made which is attached to the license you bought.
