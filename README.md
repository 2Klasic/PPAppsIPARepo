# PPAppsIPARepo
This is where I will be posting the Updated UnlimApps ++ Apps as The updates come out.

If there is an issue please leave a comment on the Reddit Post or On this GitHub repo in the "Issues" tab.

Note: 
Apps that have "Install as Duplicate" means that that IPA will be installed along side the App Store version
Apps that have "Non Duplicate" means that they are installed instead of the App Store one. 

Also know that sideloaded apps will NOT get notifications. That is why I included the IPA just compiled as Duplicate so that you can recieve notifications through the App Store one if you choose to want Notifications.
